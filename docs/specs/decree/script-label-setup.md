# Label Setup Script

## Overview

One-time shell script that creates the required GitHub labels for the workflow system. The script
ensures all labels defined by the development protocol exist in the repository with correct names,
descriptions, and colors. It is idempotent and safe to run repeatedly.

## Constraints

- Must use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub API operations
- Must be a single Bash script at `scripts/workflow/setup-labels.sh`
- Must be idempotent: running multiple times produces the same result as running once
- Must not delete or modify labels that are not defined by this script
- Must not fail if a label already exists with the correct configuration
- Must authenticate using `scripts/workflow/gh.sh` (see [github-cli.md](./github-cli.md))
- Must require no arguments

## Specification

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/workflow/setup-labels.sh
```

No arguments. The script operates on the repository determined by `gh`'s current repo context (i.e.,
the repo for the current working directory).

### Authentication

The script delegates all `gh` CLI calls to `scripts/workflow/gh.sh`, which handles authentication
automatically (token generation, caching, and `GH_TOKEN` export). The label setup script does not
manage tokens directly.

If the wrapper exits non-zero before reaching `gh`, authentication has failed. The wrapper prints
diagnostics to stderr. The label setup script detects the non-zero exit and exits immediately with
code `1`.

### Label Definitions

#### Type Labels

| Label             | Description                | Color    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| `task:implement`  | Implementation work        | `1d76db` |
| `task:refinement` | Spec clarification request | `5319e7` |

#### Status Labels

| Label                     | Description                         | Color    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `status:pending`          | Not yet started                     | `bfd4f2` |
| `status:in-progress`      | Actively being worked               | `0e8a16` |
| `status:blocked`          | Waiting on non-spec blocker         | `d93f0b` |
| `status:needs-refinement` | Blocked on spec issue               | `fbca04` |
| `status:unblocked`        | Previously blocked, ready to resume | `c2e0c6` |
| `status:review`           | PR submitted, awaiting review       | `006b75` |
| `status:needs-changes`    | Review rejected                     | `e99695` |
| `status:approved`         | Ready to merge                      | `2ea44f` |

#### Priority Labels

| Label             | Description             | Color    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `priority:high`   | Do first                | `b60205` |
| `priority:medium` | Default                 | `e4e669` |
| `priority:low`    | Do when capacity allows | `c5def5` |

#### Complexity Labels

| Label                | Description                                    | Color    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `complexity:simple`  | Straightforward task — single-file, mechanical | `d4c5f9` |
| `complexity:complex` | Multi-file or architecturally nuanced task     | `7057ff` |

### Script Behavior

The script processes each label in the following order: type labels, status labels, priority labels,
complexity labels.

For each label:

1. Check if the label already exists in the repository using `gh label list`.
2. If the label does not exist, create it using `gh label create` with the defined name,
   description, and color.
3. If the label already exists but has an incorrect description or color, update it using
   `gh label edit` to match the defined values.
4. If the label already exists with the correct configuration, skip it.

### Fetching Existing Labels

The script fetches the full list of existing labels once at startup using:

```bash
gh label list --limit 100 --json name,color,description
```

This assumes the repository has fewer than 100 total labels. The script does not need to handle
pagination.

> **Rationale:** This is a safe assumption for this project, which uses a small, fixed set of
> workflow labels.

The returned JSON uses 6-character lowercase hex color values without a `#` prefix (e.g.,
`"1d76db"`). The script must compare colors in this format.

The script uses `jq` to parse the JSON output.

### Creating and Updating Labels

To create a new label:

```bash
gh label create "<name>" --description "<description>" --color "<hex without #>"
```

To update an existing label:

```bash
gh label edit "<name>" --description "<description>" --color "<hex without #>"
```

### Output Format

The script prints one line per label processed, indicating the action taken:

```
   created  task:implement
   created  task:refinement
up-to-date  status:pending
   updated  status:in-progress
   created  status:blocked
...
```

Each line has the format: `<action>  <label-name>` where `<action>` is left-padded with spaces to 10
characters (the length of `up-to-date`) so that label names align vertically. `<action>` is one of:

- `created` -- label did not exist and was created
- `updated` -- label existed but had incorrect description or color and was updated
- `up-to-date` -- label already existed with correct configuration, no action taken
- `failed` -- label create or update command returned an error. The `failed` status line is printed
  to stdout (keeping the per-line log consistent); the underlying error detail from `gh` is printed
  to stderr.

At the end of execution, the script prints a blank line followed by a summary line:

```
Done: 3 created, 1 updated, 9 up-to-date, 0 failed
```

The summary format is: `Done: <N> created, <N> updated, <N> up-to-date, <N> failed` where each `<N>`
is the count for that action. The four counts must sum to the total number of labels defined by the
script.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | All labels processed successfully                               |
| `1`  | One or more labels failed to create or update (partial failure) |

### Error Handling

- If `gh` or `jq` is not installed, the script exits immediately with a descriptive error message
  and exit code `1`.
- If the `gh.sh` wrapper fails (authentication error), the script exits immediately with exit code
  `1`. The wrapper handles its own error messaging.
- If fetching the existing label list fails, the script exits immediately with a descriptive error
  message and exit code `1`.
- If a single label create/update fails, the script logs the error for that label (to stderr),
  continues processing remaining labels, and exits with code `1` after all labels are attempted.
- The script must not silently swallow errors.

### Idempotency

The script is idempotent. Running it multiple times:

- Does not create duplicate labels
- Corrects labels that have drifted from their defined configuration (wrong color or description)
- Reports `up-to-date` for labels that already match

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given the script file exists at `scripts/workflow/setup-labels.sh`, when inspected, then it is
      executable (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Given a repository with no workflow labels, when the script is run, then all defined labels
      are created with correct names, descriptions, and colors
- [ ] Given all workflow labels already exist with correct configuration, when the script is run,
      then output shows `up-to-date` for every label and exit code is `0`
- [ ] Given a label exists with an incorrect color, when the script is run, then the label is
      updated to the correct color and output shows `updated` for that label
- [ ] Given a label exists with an incorrect description, when the script is run, then the label is
      updated to the correct description and output shows `updated` for that label
- [ ] Given labels unrelated to the workflow exist in the repository, when the script is run, then
      those labels are not modified or deleted
- [ ] Given the script has run, when the summary line is printed, then it matches the format
      `Done: <N> created, <N> updated, <N> up-to-date, <N> failed` and the four counts sum to the
      total number of defined labels
- [ ] Given `gh` is not installed, when the script is run, then it exits with code `1` and prints an
      error message to stderr
- [ ] Given `jq` is not installed, when the script is run, then it exits with code `1` and prints an
      error message to stderr
- [ ] Given the token script fails (e.g., missing credentials), when the script is run, then it
      exits with code `1` before attempting any label operations
- [ ] Given a label fails to create, when the script continues, then remaining labels are still
      attempted and the final exit code is `1`
