# Implementor Agent

## Overview

Agent that executes assigned tasks by reading task issues and referenced specs, writing code and
tests within declared scope, and surfacing blockers when it cannot proceed. An Implementor works on
one task at a time; parallelism is achieved by running multiple Implementor instances, not by
assigning multiple tasks to one agent.

## Constraints

- Must work on exactly one task at a time.
- Must use `scripts/workflow/gh.sh` for all GitHub CLI operations (see
  [skill-github-workflow.md: Authentication](./skill-github-workflow.md#authentication) for wrapper
  behavior).
- Must conform to the project's code style, naming conventions, and patterns defined in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Must use conventional commit format for commit messages and PR titles.
- Must not reprioritize tasks or change task sequencing. Executes what is assigned.
- Must not make interpretive decisions when the spec is ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete.
  Escalate as a blocker instead.
- The PR is the agent's primary deliverable. Code changes without a submitted PR have no value to
  the workflow — the engine cannot detect completion, the Reviewer cannot be dispatched, and the
  worktree will be destroyed. A task is not complete until a PR exists.
- The agent definition body must include the permitted bash command list from
  [agent-hook-bash-validator.md: Allowlist Prefixes](./agent-hook-bash-validator.md#allowlist-prefixes)
  to prevent wasted turns on blocked commands.
- When debugging a test or validation failure, re-reading a file the agent has already read in the
  current session indicates the failure exceeds the agent's ability to resolve efficiently. The
  agent must escalate as a blocker (type: `debugging-limit`) rather than re-reading files to trace a
  failure.

## Agent Profile

| Constraint       | Value                                            | Rationale                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model tier       | Opus (default)                                   | Implementation requires strong reasoning; overridden by engine based on task complexity |
| Tool access      | Full write (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash) | Must create and modify source code and tests                                            |
| Turn budget      | 100                                              | Open-ended implementation work requires higher budget than analysis                     |
| Permission model | Non-interactive with bash validation             | Runs unattended; bash validator enforces command safety                                 |

The agent definition (`.claude/agents/implementor.md`) implements these constraints as frontmatter.
The Engine overrides the model at dispatch time based on the task's complexity label (see
[control-plane-engine.md: Dispatch Logic](./control-plane-engine.md#dispatch-logic)). See
[control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md: Agent Definition Loading](./control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md#agent-definition-loading)
for how the Engine parses frontmatter.

## Trigger

The Implementor is invoked with a task issue number under three scenarios:

1. **New task** — A `status:pending` task is selected for implementation.
2. **Task unblocked** — A previously blocked task moves to `status:unblocked`.
3. **Task needs changes** — A reviewed task moves to `status:needs-changes`.

The agent determines the scenario from the task's current status label.

## Inputs

The Engine injects the following into the agent's session at dispatch time (see
[control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md: Trigger Context](./control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md#trigger-context)
and [Project Context Injection](./control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md#project-context-injection)):

1. **Trigger prompt:** An enriched prompt containing the task issue details (number, title, body,
   labels). When a linked PR exists (resume scenarios), the prompt additionally includes per-file PR
   diffs and prior review history. See
   [control-plane-engine-context-precomputation.md: Implementor Context Pre-computation](./control-plane-engine-context-precomputation.md#implementor-context-pre-computation)
   for the prompt format.
2. **Project context:** CLAUDE.md content (coding conventions, style rules, architecture) appended
   to the agent's system prompt.
3. **Working directory:** A git worktree (see
   [control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md: Agent Lifecycle](./control-plane-engine-agent-manager.md#agent-lifecycle),
   step 2). For new tasks, the worktree is on a fresh branch. For resumed tasks (`status:unblocked`,
   `status:needs-changes`), the worktree is on the existing PR branch.

The agent fetches remaining data via tool calls: referenced spec sections and in-scope file state.
The task issue body, PR diffs, and review comments are pre-computed in the trigger prompt.

## Execution Scenarios

The agent's behavior differs based on the task's status label at invocation. The engine guarantees
dispatch preconditions (valid status label, task structure, spec existence, PR existence for resume
scenarios) — the agent trusts its input.

### New Task (status:pending)

The agent transitions the label to `status:in-progress` before any code changes, then implements the
task and submits a ready-for-review PR linked to the task issue via `Closes #<issue-number>`. The PR
title follows conventional commit format. The branch name is assigned by the engine — the agent
pushes on whatever branch its worktree starts on.

### Resume from Unblocked (status:unblocked)

The worktree is on the existing PR branch. The agent reviews the original blocker and any resolution
comments, transitions the label to `status:in-progress`, then continues implementation from
preserved progress. On completion, the existing draft PR is converted to ready-for-review (not a new
PR).

### Resume from Needs-Changes (status:needs-changes)

The worktree is on the existing PR branch. The agent reads the PR review comments to understand
requested changes, transitions the label to `status:in-progress`, then addresses each review comment
within scope. Fixes are pushed to the existing PR — no new PR is opened, and the draft-to-ready
conversion does not apply (the PR is already ready-for-review).

If a review comment requests changes to out-of-scope files, the agent posts an escalation comment
(see
[workflow-contracts.md: Escalation Comment Format](./workflow-contracts.md#escalation-comment-format))
explaining the scope constraint and continues with in-scope fixes. Exception: if the project owner
explicitly requests a scope extension in their review, the agent treats it as an authorized override
— it posts an escalation comment for traceability and proceeds with the implementation.

### Pre-submit Validation

In all scenarios, the agent runs pre-submit validation (lint, format, typecheck, tests) before
completing. If validation fails due to the agent's changes, it fixes and re-runs. If validation
fails due to something outside the agent's scope (pre-existing failure, broken dependency), it
treats the failure as a blocker.

## Blocker Handling

When the agent encounters something that prevents continued progress:

1. Stop work immediately.
2. Open a draft PR to preserve progress (if no PR exists yet).
3. Post a blocker comment on the task issue using the Blocker Comment Format (see
   [workflow-contracts.md: Blocker Comment Format](./workflow-contracts.md#blocker-comment-format)).
4. Transition the label from `status:in-progress` to:
   - `status:needs-refinement` for spec blockers (ambiguity, contradiction, gap)
   - `status:blocked` for non-spec blockers (external dependency, technical constraint, debugging
     limit)

### Escalations

When the agent identifies a non-blocking issue (e.g., scope conflict with another task, priority
conflict, judgment call), it posts an escalation comment using the Escalation Comment Format (see
[workflow-contracts.md: Escalation Comment Format](./workflow-contracts.md#escalation-comment-format))
and continues working. Escalations do not stop work and do not change the status label. If the issue
later prevents progress, it becomes a blocker.

## Scope Enforcement

The agent must only modify files listed in the task issue's "In Scope" section, subject to the scope
enforcement rules defined in
[workflow-contracts.md: Scope Enforcement Rules](./workflow-contracts.md#scope-enforcement-rules)
(primary scope, co-located test files, incidental changes, scope inaccuracy).

When non-incidental changes to out-of-scope files are needed:

- If it blocks progress: treat as a blocker (type: `technical-constraint`).
- If it does not block progress: post an escalation (type: `scope-conflict`) and continue.

## Status Transitions

| From                   | To                        | When                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `status:pending`       | `status:in-progress`      | Starting work on a new task        |
| `status:unblocked`     | `status:in-progress`      | Resuming a previously blocked task |
| `status:needs-changes` | `status:in-progress`      | Resuming after reviewer feedback   |
| `status:in-progress`   | `status:needs-refinement` | Blocked by spec issue              |
| `status:in-progress`   | `status:blocked`          | Blocked by non-spec issue          |

The agent must not perform any other status transitions.

## Completion Output

On every run (success or blocker), the agent returns the Implementor Completion Output (see
[workflow-contracts.md: Implementor Completion Output](./workflow-contracts.md#implementor-completion-output))
as its final text output to the invoking process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a `status:pending` task, when the agent starts work, then the label is updated to
      `status:in-progress` before any code changes are made.
- [ ] Given a task issue with a "Spec Reference" field, when the agent starts work, then it reads
      the referenced spec file and sections before writing code.
- [ ] Given a task with an "In Scope" file list, when the agent completes work, then only files in
      primary scope, co-located test files, incidental changes, and documented scope inaccuracies
      have been modified.
- [ ] Given a task whose In Scope list names a file that does not contain the expected code, when
      the task intent is unambiguous, then the agent determines the correct target file, proceeds
      with implementation, and documents the discrepancy in the PR body.
- [ ] Given a task whose In Scope list names a file that does not contain the expected code, when
      the discrepancy makes the task intent unclear, then the agent treats it as a blocker (type:
      `spec-gap`).
- [ ] Given a satisfiable task, when the agent completes work, then a ready-for-review PR exists
      linked to the task issue via `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- [ ] Given a spec ambiguity during implementation, when the agent stops work, then a draft PR
      preserves progress, a blocker comment is posted, and the label is `status:needs-refinement`.
- [ ] Given a non-spec blocker during implementation, when the agent stops work, then a draft PR
      preserves progress, a blocker comment is posted, and the label is `status:blocked`.
- [ ] Given a `status:unblocked` task, when the agent resumes, then it continues from preserved
      progress on the existing PR branch.
- [ ] Given a `status:unblocked` task, when the agent completes, then the existing draft PR is
      converted to ready-for-review.
- [ ] Given a `status:needs-changes` task, when the agent resumes, then it pushes fixes to the
      existing PR branch.
- [ ] Given a needs-changes review comment requesting out-of-scope changes, when the comment is not
      from the project owner, then the agent posts an escalation comment and continues with in-scope
      fixes.
- [ ] Given a needs-changes review where the project owner explicitly requests a scope extension,
      when the agent proceeds with the out-of-scope changes, then it posts an escalation comment for
      traceability before implementing.
- [ ] Given a non-blocking issue (scope conflict, priority conflict), when the agent posts an
      escalation, then it continues working and does not change the status label.
- [ ] Given the agent finishes execution (any outcome), then it returns a completion summary
      matching the Implementor Completion Output format.
